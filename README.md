# Hidden Markov Ploidy
Tool for inferring ploidy levels, testing for aneuploidy and other stuff.
Calculating its allele frequencies and genotype likelihoods requires to download the following tool

## Simulate data

Simulate poliploidy data: set the ploidy numbers, haploid depths and number of individuals editing the options in the file `simulationScript.sh`.

### Example:
simulate a genome with the sequence of ploidy numbers 2-5-4-2 for two different haploid depths, 3X and 8X, and two different amount of individuals, 5 and 10. Inside the script, edit the options as it follows
